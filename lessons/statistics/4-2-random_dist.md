[Think Stats Chapter 4 Exercise 2](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2005.html#toc41) (a random distribution)

>> The numbers generated by random.random are supposed to be
>> uniform between 0 and 1; that is, every value in the range should have the
>> same probability.
>> Generate 1000 numbers from random.random and plot their PMF and CDF.
>> Is the distribution uniform?



```
# Python Code


import numpy as np
import thinkstats2
import thinkplot

## Generate 1000 random numbers
t = np.random.random(1000)

## Create and plot its PMF:
pmf = thinkstats2.Pmf(t)
thinkplot.Pmf(pmf, linewidth=0.1)
thinkplot.Config(xlabel='Random variate', ylabel='PMF')
```

```
## Create and plot its CDF:
cdf = thinkstats2.Cdf(t)
thinkplot.Cdf(cdf)
thinkplot.Config(xlabel='Random variate', ylabel='CDF')
```
