[Think Stats Chapter 4 Exercise 2](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2005.html#toc41) (a random distribution)

>> The numbers generated by random.random are supposed to be
>> uniform between 0 and 1; that is, every value in the range should have the
>> same probability.
>> Generate 1000 numbers from random.random and plot their PMF and CDF.
>> Is the distribution uniform?



```python


import numpy as np
import thinkstats2
import thinkplot
t = np.random.random(1000)

pmf = thinkstats2.Pmf(t)
thinkplot.Pmf(pmf, linewidth=0.1)
thinkplot.Config(xlabel='Random variate', ylabel='PMF')
```
![pmf](img/pmf%20random.png)  

```
cdf = thinkstats2.Cdf(t)
thinkplot.Cdf(cdf)
thinkplot.Config(xlabel='Random variate', ylabel='CDF')
```
